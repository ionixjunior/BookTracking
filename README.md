# Book Tracking

This project is an iOS app using Swift and the View Code approach. The layout was inspired by the Book Tracking App at Dribbble https://dribbble.com/shots/6038744-Book-Tracking-App-WIP.

At the moment, only the reading screen was created. This project is still under development.

I wrote in a blog post my first impressions about developing this app clone using View Code https://ionixjunior.dev/en/book-tracking-app-clone-using-view-code-in-swift/
